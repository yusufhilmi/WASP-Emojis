# Hermes Face Animations

Hermes is smart robot assistance. Hermes is actually an adult toy but it is not giving you its whole abilities instead it acts like a mysterious box that is opened by the quests we have prepared. 
By finishing quests at our coding game people can access to Hermes' features such as speaking, responding to sound, listening to music, etc. The idea was to create a modular assistance robot and ship modules with the quests after a quick research we found out that it was too costly and pivoted to a toy that teaches fundamentals of Computer Science.

This repo contains the very basic face animation implementations.
